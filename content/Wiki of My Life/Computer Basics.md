# How to Use a Search Engine Effectively to Achieve Optimal Results

Searching for information on the Internet can be a daunting task. 
There are so many websites out there, with so much data, that it may 
seem impossible to get the results you want.

But thanks to things like boolean search syntax, you can narrow down your search to exactly what you need.

Boolean search syntax is a way to use special words to help you find exactly what you're looking for when searching online.

Here is an example of a basic search query for `freecodecamp curriculum`.

When you search for `freecodecamp curriculum`, the search engine will return results that match *any* of these keywords – typically sorted by relevance (how likely they are to match, or be related to, more of your query).

But what if you only wanted results that matched both keywords? Well,
 you might have heard that you can wrap a query in quotation marks, like
 `"freecodecamp curriculum"`.

However, this query specifically matches the *phrase* `freecodecamp curriculum`. This means that the results you will see will be limited to sites that say `freecodecamp curriculum` together, not sites that say `freecodecamp` AND `curriculum`.

If you want to match sites that include both of those terms, but not 
necessarily next to each other as a phrase, you can prefix each term 
with a plus symbol like this: `+freecodecamp +curriculum`

Alternatively, maybe you're interested in freeCodeCamp's initiatives 
outside of the curriculum. In this case, you can prefix the term `curriculum` with a minus symbol like this: `+freecodecamp -curriculum`.

This will return results that mention `freecodecamp`, but exclude results that also mention `curriculum`.

Or maybe you have a specific site you want to search, like our news platform? You can use `site:` followed by the URL of the site you want to search: `site:freecodecamp.org/news curriculum`.

This query returns all results from `freecodecamp.org/news` that contain the word `curriculum`.

By combining these tools, you can come up with very specific queries to get the exact information you need.

For example, the query `site:freecodecamp.org/news +python -curriculum` would search for Python articles on our news site, excluding articles that might talk about our curriculum.

Search operators may vary, so it is always important to check the documentation for your preferred search engine.

But you should now be empowered to get the exact results you want from your web searches.

# How Can You Use File Management Applications on Your Computer?

A file management application is a way to easily store, organize, and
 edit your files on your computer. Whether you use a Mac or Windows 
computer, there are built-in applications you can use to organize your 
files.

If you have a Windows computer, the default file manager is the File 
Explorer. This is used to browse, search, and manage files and folders, 
as well as perform file operations like copying, moving, and deleting.

To find the File Explorer, you can go to the Start menu or press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.

To pin a folder, you can right click with your mouse and select 
"Pin". To move a file or folder, you first need to select it, then 
select "Cut" and then navigate to the new location to paste it.

If you have a Mac computer, the default file manager is the Finder. 
This provides access to local and remote files, supports file previews, 
and offers a variety of organizational features like tags and Smart 
Folders.

To access the Finder on your Mac, go to the Dock at the bottom and click on the Finder icon.

You will notice a sidebar on the left-hand side where your favorite folders are located.

One way to organize your files, is to use tags. To tag a file or 
folder, you can select the item in the Finder and then right click with 
your mouse. You will see the "Tags..." option in the dropdown and you 
can apply a custom colored tag.

To search for tagged items, you can scroll to the bottom of the 
sidebar and click on the corresponding colored tag, or you can search 
for the tag by color name in the search field.

Another way to organize your files is to use smart folders. Smart 
folders are collections of files that are automatically organized based 
on criteria you set, such as file type, date, or keywords.

Whether you're using File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac, these
 applications provide flexibility to manage your files with features 
like tags, search, and Smart Folders.

# What Are Best Practices for Naming Files for Web Applications?

As you start to build out your own web applications, you will need to be mindful of what you name your files.

You will want to name your files in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.

Let's take a look at some examples of good and bad file names for HTML files. Note that the `.html` extension in these examples tells us that this is an HTML file.

Here is an example of a bad file name:

```markdown
index1234.html
```

By the name alone, it is not clear what the file is about. This file 
could be for a products page, blog page, or any other type of page but 
we don't know that from the file name.

Here is an example of a better file name for an HTML file:

```markdown
about-us.html
```

By using a more descriptive name like `about-us.html`, it is clear what the file is about.

You will also notice in this file name that there are no spaces. Instead, you use a hyphen, `-`, to separate the words.

Sometimes you might see a file name called `index.html`. This is a special file name that is used to represent the main page of a website. When you visit a website, the `index.html` file is the first file that is loaded.

Another important consideration when naming files is the use of special characters.

Using a mixture of special characters, numbers, and letters can make it difficult to understand what the file is about.

Here is an example of a bad file name:

```markdown
file-1!@.html
```

This name looks unnecessarily complicated and does not give us any information about what the file is about.

So it is best to stick with only using letters and dashes in your file names.

As you start to learn more languages, you will see that there are 
common conventions for naming files in those languages as well.

In these situations, it is always best to consult with official 
documentation or other resources to understand the best practices for 
naming files in that language.

Also you will be in situations where you are working on a team and 
you will need to follow the conventions that the team has established 
for naming files.

Always consult with the team's style guide to make sure your file names are consistent with the rest of the team.

# What Are Best Practices for File/Folder Organization in Web Applications?

When building out web applications, it is important to think about 
the organization of your files and folders. This will help keep your 
code organized and easier to maintain.

Let's take a look at an example folder structure for an HTML and CSS project:

```bash
.
├── /assets
│   ├── /images
│   │   ├── logo.png
│   │   ├── banner.jpg
│   │   └── icons.svg
│   ├── /fonts
│   │   ├── custom-font.woff
│   │   └── custom-font.woff2
├── /css
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── about.css
│   └── contact.css
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
└── README.md
```

At the top of the example, there is a single dot, which represents the root directory.

The root directory is the top-level directory in a file system, 
serving as the starting point for all file paths and containing all 
other directories and files. A directory is another name for a folder.

Inside the root directory, the first directory shown is the `assets` directory. The term `assets` refers to any files that are used in the project, such as images, fonts, or other resources.

In this example, there are two directories inside the `assets` directory called `images` and `fonts`.

The next directory would be the `css` directory. Sometimes this is also referred to as a stylesheets directory. This is where you would store all of your CSS files.

Below the `css` directory are the HTML files. The `index.html` file represents the homepage, while `about.html` and `contact.html` represent the About and Contact pages, respectively.

Lastly, there is a `README.md` file. `README` 
files are commonly used to provide useful information about the project,
 such as what it does, how to use it, and any other relevant details.

The `.md` extension stands for Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is often used to write documentation.

By organizing your project into assets, CSS, and HTML files, it makes
 it easy to find what you are looking for. This also makes it easy for 
other developers to contribute to your project.

It is important to note that this is just one example of how you can 
organize your files and folders. There are many different ways to 
structure a project.

# How Can You Create, Move, and Delete Files and Folders Using Explorer/Finder?

To create a file on Windows using the Explorer, you can click on the 
"New" option at the top left. This will show you a list of the different
 types of files that you can create.

You can also create files in their corresponding applications. Let's create a text file to show you the process.

When you click on "New" and select the file type, you will see a new 
text file in your current folder with a default name. You can rename it 
if you'd like.

The process of creating folders is exactly the same. Click the "New" 
button at the top left and then select the "Folder" option or 
right-click on an empty spot and go to "New." Then, select the "Folder" 
option. You'll see a new empty folder in your current location.

You can rename files and folders by selecting them and clicking on 
the "Rename" option at the top. When current name of the file is 
highlighted, you can start writing the new name of the file. Press Enter
 to confirm the changes.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the file or folder and select 
the "Rename" option or use the F2 keyboard shortcut. Write the new name 
and press Enter to confirm the changes.

You can move a file or folder to another folder by dragging and 
dropping it into the destination folder, if you have it opened it as a 
tab.

You can also select the file or folder and select the "Cut" option at the top.

Then, go to the destination folder and paste it by clicking the 
"Paste" button at the top. If you copied or cut the file previously, 
this button will be enabled.

You can also do this by right-clicking on an empty spot and then 
clicking on the paste icon. This will remove the file or folder from its
 original location.

To delete a file or folder, click on it and then click on the Trash 
icon at the top. You will also find a "Delete" option if you right-click
 on it.

Great. Now let's see how you can do this on macOS using Finder.

Finder is the default file manager on macOS.

To create a file on macOS, you need to open an application that lets 
you create the type of document that you need to create. Currently, 
there isn't a built-in way to create a file directly on Finder.

For example, to create a simple plain text file, you can open 
TextEdit and save your file. The process works exactly the same for any 
type of file.

There are many ways to open TextEdit. One of them is to go to 
Launchpad. Then, search for an app where you can create the type of file
 that you're interested in. In this case, that would be "TextEdit." 
Click on the icon to open the app.

Once you are inside the app, you should see an option to save your 
file in the File menu. This menu is located at the top left, next to the
 Apple menu icon.

In one of the App menu options, you should see a command to save the file. This is usually under the File menu.

Next to it, you will see the keyboard shortcut for saving your file. This is usually `Command + S` on macOS.

When you are saving the file for the first time, you should see a 
dialog window, where you can write the name of the file and choose a 
location.

Usually, the file extension is added by the application automatically but you can change it before saving the file.

After saving the file, you can open Finder by clicking on the Finder 
icon in the Dock. You should see your new file in the folder where you 
saved it.

To create a new folder, you should go to the location where you want 
to create that new folder and right-click on an empty spot. You will see
 a list of options. The first option is "New Folder."

If you click on it, you can assign a name to your new folder. Write the name and press Enter to confirm.

There are multiple ways to move files and folders in Finder. If you 
need to move them to a folder listed in your Finder "Favorites" section,
 you can just drag and drop it.

If you need to move it to a different folder, you have two options.

You can either open the destination folder as a tab and drag and drop the file or folder into the tab.

Or you can use keyboard shortcuts. First, copy the file with `Command + C`, go to the new folder, and then use `Command + Option + V` to paste the file or folder in that location. This will also remove it from the original folder.

To delete a file or folder, you can right-click on it and select "Move to trash."

You can also drag and drop them into the trash icon on the Dock. This is equivalent.

When the file or folder is in the trash can, you can right-click on 
it to delete it immediately or you can empty the trash to remove all the
 deleted files and folders permanently.

Knowing how to create, move, and delete files and folders on Windows 
and macOS is very important. By mastering these skills, you can organize
 your files, locate them quickly, and free up storage on your computer 
by deleting unnecessary files.
